# Module 1 - Summary of Learning

The biggest part of this module, for me, was getting acquainted with python's language and syntax, as I had never used it before.
I also used this as an opportunity to look at some of the data I had been using for my research in a way I hadn't already (using PDFs and 
specifically scatterplots between variables that I had thus far only plotted on maps or with respect to altitude).  I didn't learn anything
particularly new, but I did end up with plots that at least looked interesting, especially the potential temp with altitude plots that looked
like Japan. Overall, the assignment was a good introduction into how to use and problem-shoot python/jupyter notebooks, and a good refresher
on PDFs and basic statistics.
