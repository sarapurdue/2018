# Module 2 Learning Summary

In module 2, I used the TimeSeries_NB1 notebook to analyze SST time series data from a location near Namibia, so that eventually I 
might be able to use it, at least for context or something, in my own research (data is from SE Atlantic, near Namibia).  It was another
good reintroduction into Fourier transforms, although I feel like for me, the 3rd module solidified how they work mechanically 
(outside of a code).  Using premade code to analyze my own data (as well as the originally provided data) helped me understand more how
the different python functions worked as well (like how changing the truncation number altered the fit of the data reconstruction fit, etc.).
